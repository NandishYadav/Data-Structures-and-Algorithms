## Introduction

This repository provides an organized collection of common data structures (like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithms (such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.) implemented in JavaScript. Each implementation is explained with comments for better understanding, and examples are provided to demonstrate usage.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine to start exploring:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-javascript.git
cd dsa-javascript

```

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript
- Node.js installed on your system to run the JavaScript files

## Data Structures

Here is a list of data structures implemented in this repository:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists** (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List)
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees** (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree)
- **Graphs** (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
- **Hash Tables**
- **Heaps** (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)

Each data structure is contained within its respective directory, with an explanation of the operations it supports (e.g., insert, delete, search).

## Algorithms

The repository includes various algorithms categorized as follows:

- **Sorting** (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort)
- **Searching** (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- **Graph Algorithms** (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- **Dynamic Programming** (Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem)
- **Recursion** (Factorial, Permutations, Combinations)
- **Others** (Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, Backtracking)

## Usage

To run and test the data structures or algorithms, use Node.js. For example, to run a binary search algorithm, navigate to its directory and execute the file:

```bash
node algorithms/searching/binarySearch.js
```

Feel free to explore, modify, and test various data structures and algorithms. Each file is well-commented to explain its logic and usage.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you have any new algorithms or data structures to add, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin new-feature`)
5. Open a pull request

Please make sure your code is well-documented and follows the existing code style.
